This project was created with Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2010. To load and run this solution you have to download also Open CV 2.4.2 from http://opencv.org/downloads.html

You have to put the Open CV folder into you C: unit, then you have to rename the folder in opencv-242

You have to do that because the Visual Studio solution has some link to that path. However you can change them. you should also put C:\opencv-242\build\x86\vc10\bin to your windows environment path.
