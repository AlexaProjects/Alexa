Alexa
=====

This repository contains the source code of Alexa, if you have any problem with Visual Studio and the external references please read the README file that you can find into the externalBin folder.

Alexa is a computer vision system that allows you to test and monitor your applications (and interact with them) simulating the human behavior.

All this is possible thanks to the artificial vision. Infact Alexa sees what's happening on the desktop and it is able to automatically identify the elements of your applications.

This feature opens up endless possibilities. Infact you can test all applications (or interact with them) that with conventional monitoring systems you can not test.

You can monitor the user experience of applications published via Citrix, you can test Java applets, Windows form, Flash applications and almost all applications that can be used by a human.

To understand how Alexa works and how to configure and train it, please read the official documentation: http://www.alan-pipitone.com/alexa/docs/

Alexa is released under GPL v3.0 license and it is developed and maintained by Alan Pipitone.
